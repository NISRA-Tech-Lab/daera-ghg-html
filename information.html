          <h2>Usage of Recorded Crime and Survey Data</h2>
        </div>

          <h3>Recorded crime data</h3>
          <p>Surveys on their own should not be used to monitor and measure prevalence and the recommended approach is to use PSNI and survey data together to measure prevalence. Both recorded crime and population level surveys have strengths and limitations but used together, will indicate a valuable baseline of VAWG in NI.</p>
          <p>Recorded crime statistics do not include crimes that are not reported to the police or that the police do not record but they include a wider range of crime types than Survey data, e.g. crimes against children, crimes against businesses and many, so-called 'victimless' crimes (such as drug possession offences).</p>
          <p>The level of recorded crime can be affected by changes in both police recording / counting practices and in levels of reporting of incidents to the police.</p>

          <h3>Survey data</h3>
          <p>Surveys may shed light on the large proportion of crime not reported to the police and the data collected are unaffected by police reporting and recording practices, however survey data coverage is usually restricted to non-fatal crimes against private households and their adult occupants (it excludes, for instance, homicide, crimes against children, fraud, crimes against businesses, organised crime and so-called 'victimless' crimes);.</p>
          <p>There are generally methodological consistencies between survey years although some surveys (or modules within) are not carried out annually. Survey data has the potential to become a more reliable device for measuring trends for crimes against households and their adult occupants. However, it doesn't facilitate local crime pattern analysis and much larger sample sizes would be required to facilitate the tracking of small, statistically significant changes in the levels of particular types of crime. Survey data is also subject to sampling and non-sampling errors.</p>

          <h3>Additional considerations</h3>
          <p>It is also worth noting that recorded crime figures cannot, by their nature, provide an impression of the extent of concern about crime (often described as 'fear of crime') among different sections of the community. For the crime types it covers, surveys provide a more complete measure of the extent and impact of crime against private households and their adult occupants, so it is necessary to complement police figures with information drawn from surveys.</p>
          <p>As exemplified above, recorded crime and survey data have different strengths and limitations but can be looked at together to provide a more comprehensive picture of prevalence of gender-based violence than could be obtained from either series alone.</p>
